## Response snapshot

I have successfully updated the project constitution for your Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Here's what was completed:

**New Version**: 1.0.0 (initial creation)
**Bump Rationale**: This is the initial creation of the constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project, establishing six core principles focused on technical accuracy, pedagogical excellence, accessibility, practical application, modular structure, and continuous maintenance.

**Files Updated**:
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Updated with all new content specific to the textbook project

**Changes Made**:
- Created 6 targeted principles specific to educational content development
- Defined content standards for academic rigor
- Established editorial review processes
- Included governance and versioning procedures
- Added Sync Impact Report documenting all changes

**No files flagged for manual follow-up** - all templates were already consistent with the new constitution.

**Suggested commit message**: `docs: add constitution for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project v1.0.0`

The constitution is now ready and saved to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with all required elements in place. It specifically addresses the needs of creating a technical textbook with focus on accuracy, educational value, accessibility, and practical applications in the field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new constitution for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project
- 🧪 Tests: none required
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Could proceed with /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully adapted template constitution to specific textbook project
